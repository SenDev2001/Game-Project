## RESEARCH 
- I have done research subway surface case atudy to better understand itts gaming mechanics and design componets, which may inspire and lead lead the development of my own game. I looked at key elements including endless runner gameplay the nessity of user input, and the usage dynamic chalanges. This case studyy helped me grasp the fundamental features of a succesful mobile game, such as level design, coins, player movements and obstacles  which i want to include to my project.

- Also I have done reseaerch Temple Run Documentation.
  - Template documentation (2024) At: https://templerun.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Template_documentation (Accessed  03/12/2024).

- I looked at documantation in unity input systems for mobile .The unity input system literature  version 1.11.2 provided a detailed description of how to configure and implement touch controllers, multi touch gestures and swipe recognition on mobile devices.

- I also watched youtube tutorials for learn to how can i do swipe detection. I found understanding  the technical parts of adding swipe features. Also these tutorials helped get the knowledge and skill need to include swipe detection mechanisms into my game.

- I have done lot of researches how to do leaderboard system using flask because I never done that.
  - Research - Welcome to Flask â€” Flask Documentation (3.1.x) (s.d.) At: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/ (Accessed  03/12/2024).

- I also watched Youtube video tutorials for how can I combine unitywebrequest with flask server. This study sought out to understand how to create cominication beetween a unity game and flask based backend server, with an concentrate on effective data send and get.

## Game Development Process
### Process Of Completeing The task 
- GamePlay Desgin: I started by researching current endless runner games to learn about effective game mechanism. I concentrated on creating important gameplay elements such as player movement, swipe gestures, obstacle avoidance(add road barriers and busses), and snow particals.
