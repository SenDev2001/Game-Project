## INTRODUCTION
Velocity Rush is a 3D endless runner game designed for android and webgl and it’s made for the winter season environment and player have run through road while snow falling and avoid obstacles and collecting coins also velocity rush has leaderboard system so players can see names and score what they got and whose got high score.
## RESEARCH 
- I have done research subway surface case study to better understand its gaming mechanics and design components, which may inspire and lead the development of my own game. I looked at key elements including endless runner gameplay the necessity of user input, and the usage dynamic challenges. This case study helped me grasp the fundamental features of a successful mobile game, such as level design, coins, player movements and obstacles which I want to include to my project.

- Also, I have done research Temple Run Documentation to get ideas for my velocity rush game, The documentation game details on gaming mechanics, design aspects, and user engagement methods. This study helped me in better understanding basic aspects such as obstacle design, powerups and level design same as subway surfers.

- I looked at documentation in unity input systems for mobile. The unity input system literature version 1.11.2 provided a detailed description of how to configure and implement touch controllers, multi touch gestures and swipe recognition on mobile devices.

- I followed YouTube videos to understand swipe detection for my first mobile game velocity rush. These tutorials demonstrated how to create swipe detection for touch and mouse inputs in unity’s new input system. I learnt how to detect directional swipes, analyse input data and combine swipe actions into game mechanism. In addition, I learnt visual upgrades such as trail effects to improve the user experience. This understanding allowed me to develop responsive and accurate swipe controls, resulting in intuitive gameplay. These elements are essential for mobile games, since they increase play interest and correspond with the main dynamics of and endless runner game.

- I have done research flask documentation to discover how to build a leaderboard system with Flask. I learnt Flask’s lightweight and flexible characteristics, as well as how to configure routes for receiving request and dynamically handle data with templates. I also looked at flask SQL Alchemy for database interaction and learnt how to create Restful APIs for leaderboard functions, Additionally I learnt how to deploy flask apps and secure routs, this study game me the groundwork to create a practical and user-friendly leaderboard system. 
  - Research - Welcome to Flask — Flask Documentation (3.1.x) (s.d.) At: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/ (Accessed 03/12/2024).
-  I did research Flask-CORS documentation to understand how to allow cross-origin requests in my flask backend. This is required when the unity game front end and flask app backend are hosted on separate domains, as browsers by default block cross origin request.
 - Flask-CORS — Flask-Cors 3.0.10 documentation (s.d.) At: https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (Accessed 12/12/2024).


- I also watched YouTube video tutorials for how can I combine unitywebrequest with flask server. This study sought out to understand how to create communication between a unity game and flask-based backend server, with a concentrate on effective data send and get.

## Game Development Process
### Process Of Completing The task 
- Gameplay Design: I started by researching current endless runner games to learn about effective game mechanism. I concentrated on creating important gameplay elements such as player movement, swipe gestures, obstacle avoidance (add road barriers and busses), and snow partials.
- Mobile Controls: I used unity’s new input System to build touch and swipe detection for seamless player interactions. 
- Testing and Feedbacks: I did user tests to identify areas for upgrades, such as Swipe detection difficulties and leaderboard access.
